Tech stack: ```Strapi, Next.js, Cloudinary```
## How I worked on this project
I created this project with the goal of adding real-world value and enhancing my financial literacy.

- I built this app based on requirements from my partner, who has a background in finance.
- I worked independently on the backend and frontend
## How to navigate this project
- This application fetches data from Strapi: Examples for the request and data transformation will be added here
- Dynamic CSS in [slug].js
## Why I built the project this way
- I used a headless CMS to make content management easy and user-friendly for my non-technical partner to use without my help or authentication.
- I didn't use a state management library because my blog app is straightforward and has a small amount of data to manage (e.g. articles, emails)
## If I had more time I would change this
- In the future, I will add more interactive features such as user authentication with varying subscription levels. This will require a state management library.
