## How I created this project:
- Built with ```Next.js``` and  ```Strapi``` (headless CMS based on Node.js)
- Image optimization: ```Cloudinary```
- Email plugin: ```Brevo```
- Deployed with ```Heroku``` and ```Vercel```

## How I worked on this project
Read a more in-depth explanation about this project [here](https://rosarezaei.digital/projects/1-wallstraven/)

- I built this app based on requirements from my friend, who has a background in finance.
- I worked independently on the backend and frontend
## How to navigate this project
- This application fetches data from Strapi: Examples for the request and data transformation will be added here
- Dynamic routes in [slug].js
- client side code can be found in /frontend
## Why I built the project this way
- I used a headless CMS to make content management easy and user-friendly for my non-technical partner to use without my help or authentication.
- I didn't use a state management library because my blog app is straightforward and has a small amount of data to manage (e.g. articles, emails)
## If I had more time I would change this
- In the future, I will add more interactive features such as user authentication with varying subscription levels. This will require a state management library.
